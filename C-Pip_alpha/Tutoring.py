#Magic Methods : 

#Part 1 : 

"""More magic methods for common operators:
__sub__ for -
__mul__ for *
__truediv__ for /
__floordiv__ for //
__mod__ for %
__pow__ for **
__and__ for &
__xor__ for ^
__or__ for |

The expression x + y is translated into x.__add__(y). 
However, if x hasn't implemented __add__, and x and y are of different types, then y.__radd__(x) is called. 
There are equivalent r methods for all magic methods just mentioned.
Example:"""
class SpecialString:
  def __init__(self, cont):
    self.cont = cont

  def __truediv__(self, other):
    line = "=" * len(other.cont)
    return "\n".join([self.cont, line, other.cont])

spam = SpecialString("spam")
hello = SpecialString("Hello world!")
#print(spam/hello)

#Part 2 
"""Python also provides magic methods for comparisons.
__lt__ for <
__le__ for <=
__eq__ for ==
__ne__ for !=
__gt__ for >
__ge__ for >=

If __ne__ is not implemented, it returns the opposite of __eq__. 
There are no other relationships between the other operators.
Example:"""

class SpecialString:
  def __init__(self, cont):
    self.cont = cont

  def __gt__(self, other):
    for index in range(len(other.cont)+1):
      result = other.cont[:index] + ">" + self.cont
      result += ">" + other.cont[index:]
      print(result)

spam = SpecialString("spam")
eggs = SpecialString("eggs")
spam > eggs
